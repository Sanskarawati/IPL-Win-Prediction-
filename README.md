  <h1>This is an Ipl Win Predictor System</h1>
<h3>Tech Stack used</h3>
<p>Python ->Machine Learning with the algorithm <b><u>Logistic Regression </b> ,streamlit</p>

<h3>Flow of Code</h3>
<p>There are 2 Datasets that are combined now in 1 are are put in pipe line where they are scaled ,one encoding is done and the passed to the model of Logistic Regression </p>
<h3>Requirement of the project</h3>
<p>Can be Used to Predict in Online Gamming Platforms that can be to earn more points </p>
<h3>
Alternative Algorithms
</h3>
<p>
 Here algorithms like Support Vector Machine ,Random Forest Classifier etc can be use
</p>
